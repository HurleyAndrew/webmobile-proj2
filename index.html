				The World Wide Web or WWW, is the term used for the vastly accessible network by the public to access data
				on other machines. More specifically, it is the information we see on our computers when we search through
				our browsers. It contains images, videos, sounds, and other information.
				The web uses the HTTP protocol, which is just one of the languages spoken over the internet.
				Web pages are locations that can be accessed by links. While the other term being, Internet,
				is a network of connected machines with the ability to transfer data between them. To access
				this information browsers are used, today we have Chrome, Opera, Sarfari, and other. But back
				in the day browsers like, Lynx, Mosaic, and Gopher were used. Lynx is the oldest browser that
				is still in use. It is a text based web browser that was started in 1992. It was initially
				going to be primarily used for the University of Kansas as a file transfer system for the c
				ampus. It does not support some really important features such as javascript and adobe flash.
				Mosaic is another browser that has been discontinued. It features FTP, NNTP, and gopher protocols.
				It had an intuitive interface and was very reliable. It was the first to display images along
				with text on the same page. Gopher is an old protocol used for file transfer. It was a menu-document
				oriented program that was ultimately taken over by http. http or hyper text transfer protocol, is
				the other way of data transfer that is based off links.
