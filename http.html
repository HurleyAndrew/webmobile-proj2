		HTTP, also known as hypertext transfer protocol, is a stateless method of object requesting.
		Stateless meaning it does now know or have any prior data of the user using it.
		This is solved by using things like cookies or javascript. And object requesting being
		the request of a file from a server. The process of this is as follows. Assuming that t
		he web hoster has files on the server and you are looking for them this is how it works.
		You insert an address into the url bar and when you hit enter that address is sent through
		a server so it can find the site. When the url or request reaches the server the server gets
		all the files associated with that address and gets them ready to send back to the browser.
		It then responds with the requested file or files that are requested back to the browser.
		The browser then interprets the files received into visual or functional items for the user to use.
